            Hello!
            I am mohammad samara from jordan, in the city of Irbid.<br />
            I have studied civil engineering at TTU university from 2014 to 2018<br />
            right now I am learning about web development at ASAC college.<br />
            I don't have any experience right now in any of the previous majors.<br />
            my goal is to become a great web developer.<br />
            I do enjoy gaming, and listening to music.
